Overall reuirements: 
python3, Jupyter Notebook/Google COLAB, cv2, keras, sklearn, tensorflow, matplotlib, sys, pandas, os, numpy

This is a descriptive analysis package. Import the CUB_200_2011 file according to the path.
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Import the data set according to the code path.
3. Describe and analyze the files in the data set respectively and execute them in code order.

For preprocessing and implementation:
1. Install all the required packages.
2. Use Jupyter Notebook (Preferably Google COLAB) with GPU runtime.
3. Execute all the cells one by one.
